- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @praetortuicu and I am a student at the University of Heidelberg, in Germany. I study mathematics but have a big passion for programming
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all sorts of programming, but my main focus are the C/C++ languages and their powerful applications in any and all domains
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C/C++, Python and Matlab
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Over my E-Mail address, of course: teodor.ticu@outlook.com
- I'd love to collaborate with projects of any size, if I have the time (because studies leave little free time :D )
