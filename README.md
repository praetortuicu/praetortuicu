- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @praetortuicu and I am a student at the University of Heidelberg, in Germany. I study computer science and have a big interest in computer graphics and simulation, as well as security
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all sorts of programming, but my main focus are the C/C++ languages and their powerful applications in any and all domains
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and working with C/C++, Python (with relation to Matlab), Java and am looking into Rust a little
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Over my E-Mail address, of course: teodor.ticu@outlook.com
- I'd love to collaborate with projects of any size, if I have the time (because studies leave little free time :D )
